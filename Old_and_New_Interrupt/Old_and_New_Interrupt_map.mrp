Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   1
Number of warnings :  12

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:198 - NCD was not produced.  All logic was removed from the design. 
   This is usually due to having no input or output PAD connections in the
   design and no nets or symbols marked as 'SAVE'.  You can either add PADs or
   'SAVE' attributes to the design, or run 'map -u' to disable logic trimming in
   the mapper.  For more information on trimming issues search the Xilinx
   Answers database for "ERROR:Pack:198" and read the Master Answer Record for
   MAP Trimming Issues.
